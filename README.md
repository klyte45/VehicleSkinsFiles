# Vehicle Skins example files
This repository contains additional skins for some vanilla and workshop assets. 
To add the skins to your game, copy the asset folder into `[Cities Skylines App Data folder]/Klyte45Mods/VehicleSkins/Skins`.
You can select only some skins in each folder, but don't forget to copy all files relative to that skin (All files from the same skin starts with the same name).

_**Remember:** Write the Signs support only will be available when the version 0.5 of that mod get released. Until there, the WTS files in the skins will be simply ignored._

Feel free to contribute with new skins by just asking via merge requests.
